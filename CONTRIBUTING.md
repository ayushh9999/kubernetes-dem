## 🎨 Style Guidelines

### Code Style

**JavaScript/Node.js:**
```javascript
// Use descriptive variable names
const serverPort = 3000;

// Add comments for complex logic
// This endpoint returns pod information for load balancing verification
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello' });
});

// Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
if (condition) {
  doSomething();
}
```

**YAML (Kubernetes):**
```yaml
# Add comments explaining configurations
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service  # Use kebab-case for names
```

### Documentation Style

- Use emojis to make docs engaging 🎉
- Keep explanations simple and clear
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots when helpful
- Use proper markdown formatting

### Commit Message Style

```
Add: Feature name

- Describe what was added
- Explain why it's useful
